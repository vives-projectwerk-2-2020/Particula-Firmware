# Using the Particula TTN application

## Adding the particula application to (and setting up) your TTN account

- Make sure you have a TTN user account. If you don't have one yet, go to [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and go to the 'Sign Up' page.
- Ask one of the application administrators to add you as a 'collaborator'. Make sure to provide him/here with your TTN username.
- Once they added you, go to the [TTN Console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/applications). You will find the 'particula' application there.

## Adding a new device

On the 'overview' tab scroll to the 'devices' section and click the 'register device' button. Now, what do you have to fill out here:

1. Device ID: Give the new device a descriptive name (if it's for development maybe add your name)
2. Device EUI: click the '🔀' button to generate a random value. 'this field will be generated' should appear in the box next to it.
3. App Key: Leave this as it is. 'this field will be generated' should also appear in the box.
4. App EUI: This is the key for the application itself (you cannot change this).

## Configuring the firmware

You will need 3 keys to configure the 'particula' firmware for your device and enable it to connect to TTN.

- devEUI
- appEUI
- appKEY

To get your keys go to the 'devices' tab and select the device you are configuring.

Click the '<>' button to toggle between hex and C-style formating for the keys. Also make sure to use the 'clipboard' button to copy a key (we don't want typos here).


## Checking the connection

After you added the 'particula' application to your account, added your device and configured the firmware with the keys for your device. It's time to compile the firmware, flash it and check if TTN is receiving the packets. To do this, go to the 'data' tab.

By clicking one of the received payloads you can get an overview of the data (and metadata) available.
